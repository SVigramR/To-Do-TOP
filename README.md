# To-Do-TOP
Welcome to my To-Do app, this is an CRUD application made with vanilla Javascript, HTML5, CSS3. I have used Date-fns library to manipulate/modify dates that are present in the Task Object. I implemented Local Storage to the app for loading the data created by the user when reloading the page. The entire application is bundled using webpack.

I used Javascript(ES6) modules to separate codes or functionalities into it's own module. I separated the functions with the concept of single responsibility principle.
